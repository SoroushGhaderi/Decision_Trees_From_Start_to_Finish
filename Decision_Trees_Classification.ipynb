    "Unfortunately the biggest part of any data analysis project is making sure that data is correctly formatted and fixing it when it is not. The first aprt of this procces is identifying and dealing with **Missing Data**\n",
    "**Missing Data** is simply a blank space, or a surrogate value like **NA**, that indicates that we failed to collect data for one of features. For example if we forget to ask someone's age, or forget to write it down, then we would have a blank space in the dataset for that person's **age**.\n",
    "There are two main ways to deal with missing data:\n",
    "1. We can remove the rows that contain missing data from dataset. This is relatively easy to do, but it wastes all of the other values that we collected. How a big of a waste this is depends on how important missing values is for classification. For example, if we are missing a value for **Age** and **Age** is not useful for classifying if people have heart disease or not, then it would be a shame to throw out all of someone's data just because we do not have their **Age**\n",
    "2. We can **impute** the values that are missing. In this context **impute** is just a fancy way of saying \"we can make an educated guess about about what the value should be\". Continuing our example where we are missing a value for **Age**. instead of throwing out the entire row of data we can fill the missing value with the average age or the median age, or use some other, more sophisticated approach , to guess at an appropriate value.\n",

All of the other columns, however, need to be inspected to make sure they only contain reasonable valuesm and some of them need to change. this is because, while **scikit-learn Decision Trees** natively support continous data, like resting blood preasure (**restbp**) and maximum heart rate (**thalach**), they do not natively support categorical data, like chest pain (**cp**), which contain 4 different categories. Thus, in order to use categorical data with **scikit-learn Decision Trees**, we have to use a trick that converts a column of categorical data into multiple columns of binary values.

That means decision tree would be more likely to cluster the paitents with 4s and 3s together than the paitents with 4s and 1s together. In contrast, if we treat these numbers like categorical data, then we treat eeach one as a separate category that is no more or less similar to any of the other categories. Thus, the likelihood of clustering paitents with 4s with 3s is the same clustering 4s with 1s, and that approach is more reasonable.\n",

    "**NOTE:** There are different ways to do **One-Hot Encoding** in python. Two of the more popular methods are `ColumnTransformer()` (from **scikit-learn**) and `get_dummies()` (from **pandas**), and the both methods have pros and cons. `ColumnTransformer()` has very cool feature where it creates and persistent function that can validate data that you get in the future. For example, if you build you **Decision Tree** using a categorical variable **favorite color** that has **red, blue** and **green** options, then `ColumnTransformer()` can remember those options and later on when your **Decision Tree** is being used in a production system, if someone says their favorite color is **orange**, then `ColumnTransformer()` can throw an error or handle the situation in some other nice way. The downside of `ColumnTransformer()` is that it turns your data into an array and looses all of the column names, making it harder to verify that your usage of `ColumnTransformer()` worked as you intended it to. In contrast, `get_dummies()` leaves your your data in a dataframe and retains the column names, making it much easier to verify that it worked as intended. However, it does not have the persistant bihavior that `ColumnTransformer()` has. so, for the sake of learning learning how **One-Hot Encoding** works. "

We have multiple options for this transformation, `map()` and `replace()`. Both of them have the same syntax and works on `pandas.Series`. We have to do this transformation to other columns for better visualization and better column names. For change values we can *write a dictionary in function* or write *dictionary and pass it thrugh function*. Both are allowed."
